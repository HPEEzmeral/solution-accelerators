# Solution Accelerators

Welcome to the HPE Solution Accelerators repository!

## Branching Model

This repository adheres to the versioning scheme of the Ezmeral Unified Analytics (EzUA) platform.
The `develop` branch serves as the hub for active development. Release branches are derived from the
develop branch, aligning closely with EzUA versions.

For instance, `release-x.y.z` is designed to seamlessly work with EzUA version `x.y.z`. It's worth
noting that when you clone this repository, the default branch aligns with the most recent EzUA
version by default. Therefore, if you're working with the latest EzUA iteration, you can clone it
and proceed without the need to switch branches.

## Getting Started

To get started you need access to an EzUA cluster. Then:

1. Navigate to the desired directory.
1. Follow the respective README file for further instructions.

## Requirements

We assume you have a basic understanding of the Python programming and some familiarity with
analytics and data science concepts. Each guide may have additional specific requirements, which
will be detailed within.
